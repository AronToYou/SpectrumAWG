wavgen!
#######

A Python package to simplify communication with a :doc:`Spectrum AWG card <info/spectrum>`, for the use & purposes
of the E6_ experiment.

The provided functionality allow you to:

+ Calculate, plot, & store custom parameterized waveforms
+ Optimize *power* & *homogeneity* of **static** microtrap configurations
+ Define sequences of waveforms capable of:

    + Conditioning step transition on a software or hardware trigger
    + Re-definition during operation

The last two features are still pre-alpha.
